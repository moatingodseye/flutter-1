This archive contains a Flutter web frontend and a Dart server backend for a timesheet application.

**Included enhancements**
- Full CRUD endpoints for users, projects, and time entries (create/read/update/delete).
- Frontend API client methods for CRUD operations.
- Frontend project UI with edit/delete.
- Reports view with PDF export (client-side download via AnchorElement).
